# python-api-challenge
A Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.


Part I - WheatherPy

**Objetive:** to answer the question What's the weather like as we approach the equator?

As we expected (and the data confirms), it gets hotter... The dataset created is for 500+ cities around the world ramdomly choosen to evaluate the Max Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed.

**Findings and observations:**

- Temperature vs. Latitude: this plot shows that the closer the latitude is to 0°, the higer is the temprature.
- Humidity vs. Latitude: it is not a clear correlation but near latitude -20° and latitude 20° the humidity its a little less than the rest of latitudes.
- Cloudiness vs. Latitude: For this day in the year we can see that between latitude -20° and 0° there is almost 100% of cloudiness and 0% between 0° and 20°.
- Wind Speed vs Latitude: there is not visible correlation in this day (more data is required in another seasons.)
- Northen and Southern Hemispheres has very similar behaviors
